## Introduction to Statistics for Data Science

### 1. What is Statistics?
Statistics is the science of collecting, organizing, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data. It helps in making informed decisions based on data analysis and provides tools for drawing meaningful conclusions from data.

### 2. Importance of Statistics in Data Science
Statistics is fundamental to data science as it provides methodologies to:
- Summarize and describe data
- Make inferences and predictions
- Test hypotheses
- Understand relationships between variables

### 3. Types of Statistics
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarize and describe the features of a dataset.
- **Inferential Statistics**: Draw conclusions and make predictions about a population based on a sample.

### 4. Descriptive Statistics
Descriptive statistics provide simple summaries about the sample and the measures.

#### 4.1 Measures of Central Tendency
- **Mean**: The average of all data points.
    ```python
    import numpy as np
    data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    mean = np.mean(data)
    print("Mean:", mean)
    ```
- **Median**: The middle value in the data set.
    ```python
    median = np.median(data)
    print("Median:", median)
    ```
- **Mode**: The most frequent value in the data set.
    ```python
    from scipy import stats
    mode = stats.mode(data)
    print("Mode:", mode.mode[0])
    ```

#### 4.2 Measures of Dispersion
- **Range**: The difference between the maximum and minimum values.
    ```python
    range_value = np.ptp(data)
    print("Range:", range_value)
    ```
- **Variance**: The average of the squared differences from the mean.
    ```python
    variance = np.var(data)
    print("Variance:", variance)
    ```
- **Standard Deviation**: The square root of the variance, representing the average distance from the mean.
    ```python
    std_dev = np.std(data)
    print("Standard Deviation:", std_dev)
    ```

#### 4.3 Data Distribution
- **Frequency Distribution**: A summary of how often each value occurs.
- **Histograms**: Graphical representation of the frequency distribution.
    ```python
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    plt.hist(data, bins=5, edgecolor='black')
    plt.xlabel('Value')
    plt.ylabel('Frequency')
    plt.title('Histogram')
    plt.show()
    ```

### 5. Inferential Statistics
Inferential statistics allow us to make predictions or inferences about a population based on a sample.

#### 5.1 Sampling
- **Population**: The entire group of individuals or instances about whom we hope to learn.
- **Sample**: A subset of the population, used to draw conclusions about the entire group.

#### 5.2 Hypothesis Testing
A method of making decisions using data, whether from a controlled experiment or an observational study.

- **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: A statement of no effect or no difference.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: A statement that contradicts the null hypothesis.

#### 5.3 p-value
The probability of observing the data, or something more extreme, assuming the null hypothesis is true. A low p-value (< 0.05) indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis.

#### 5.4 Confidence Intervals
A range of values derived from the sample that is likely to contain the population parameter.
    ```python
    import scipy.stats as stats
    confidence_level = 0.95
    degrees_freedom = len(data) - 1
    sample_mean = np.mean(data)
    sample_standard_error = stats.sem(data)
    confidence_interval = stats.t.interval(confidence_level, degrees_freedom, sample_mean, sample_standard_error)
    print("Confidence Interval:", confidence_interval)
    ```

### 6. Correlation and Regression
#### 6.1 Correlation
A measure of the relationship between two variables. It ranges from -1 to 1.
- **Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r)**: Measures linear correlation.
    ```python
    correlation = np.corrcoef(data, other_data)
    print("Pearson Correlation Coefficient:", correlation)
    ```

#### 6.2 Linear Regression
A method to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
    ```python
    from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

    # Sample data
    X = np.array([[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]])
    y = np.array([1, 3, 2, 3, 5])

    # Creating and training the model
    model = LinearRegression()
    model.fit(X, y)

    # Making predictions
    predictions = model.predict(X)
    print("Predictions:", predictions)
    ```

### 7. Probability
The study of randomness and uncertainty. It quantifies the likelihood of different outcomes.

#### 7.1 Basic Concepts
- **Experiment**: A process that produces an outcome.
- **Sample Space**: The set of all possible outcomes.
- **Event**: A subset of the sample space.

#### 7.2 Probability Distributions
- **Discrete Probability Distributions**: Probability of discrete outcomes (e.g., Binomial distribution).
    ```python
    from scipy.stats import binom
    # Probability of getting 3 heads in 10 flips of a fair coin
    n = 10
    p = 0.5
    k = 3
    probability = binom.pmf(k, n, p)
    print("Binomial Probability:", probability)
    ```
- **Continuous Probability Distributions**: Probability of continuous outcomes (e.g., Normal distribution).
    ```python
    from scipy.stats import norm
    # Probability of a value falling within 1 standard deviation of the mean
    probability = norm.cdf(1) - norm.cdf(-1)
    print("Normal Distribution Probability:", probability)
    ```

### 8. Data Visualization for Statistical Analysis
Visualizing data can help to understand distributions, patterns, and relationships.

#### 8.1 Box Plot
```python
sns.boxplot(data=data)
plt.title('Box Plot')
plt.show()
```

#### 8.2 Scatter Plot
```python
sns.scatterplot(x='X', y='Y', data=df, hue='Category')
plt.title('Scatter Plot')
plt.show()
```

### 9. Conclusion
Statistics is a crucial part of data science that provides methods for collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data. By understanding and applying statistical concepts, you can make more informed decisions and extract valuable insights from your data.
